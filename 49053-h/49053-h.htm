<h2>James Gordon Bennett’s Editorial Career.</h2>

<p>Bennett left his native hills of Scotland in
1819, and arrived in Boston in 1820. After
enduring the tortures of poor Goldsmith (as
teacher, traveler, editor, and author) for fifteen
years, he takes the basement of the
crumbling ruin at No. 20 Wall street, and advertises
for a boy, when John Kelly (now a
Member of Congress from the Fourth, Sixth,
Tenth, and Fourteenth Wards) thus responds:</p>

<p><i>Enter John Kelly in rags and barefooted.</i></p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Mr. Bennett: Mother says you advertised
for a boy, and sent me to ask you for
the situation.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;What’s your name?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Johnny Kelly.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Where do you live?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;In the Fourteenth Ward.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;How long have you been in this
country?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;I have always been in this beautiful
country.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Aint you an Irish boy?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;No, sir,&mdash;I am an American boy,
and I’m very glad I am an American.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Why are you glad of that?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Because George Washington was an
American, and I dearly love his memory,
because he always spoke the truth, and was
good and brave, and loved and saved his
country.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Who told you all this?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;My grandfather first told me of
Washington’s greatness, and goodness, and
bravery, and since he died, I have read the
Life of Washington several times.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Where was your grandfather
born?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;In Scotland.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Ah! then, you are of Scotch
descent?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Did you ever hear of Wallace?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Yes, sir, and of William Tell, and his
son Albert, of Switzerland. Grandfather
told me all about their courageous deeds and
great love of country.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Where were your parents born?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;In poor old Ireland.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Why did they leave their country?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Because liberty was dead, and the
people starving, and sorely oppressed by
tyrants.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Who crushed the liberty of Ireland?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;England, Scotland, and Wales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;That will do, my boy, and I am
pleased with your intelligence and love of
liberty, though you should not denounce the
glorious Scotland, because your grandfather
came from its pretty vales and majestic mountains.</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;If Scotland and Wales had sympathised
with Ireland, and fought her battles for
freedom, the sweetest and greenest Isle of all
the earth would now be free like my dear
America, and Scotland and Wales could also
have enjoyed the blessings of liberty.</p>

<p class="pc"><i>Enter Washer Woman.</i></p>

<p><i>Washer Woman</i>&mdash;And so I have caught the
old Scotch Serpent at last, eh? I have been
here a dozen times, and also at your last
boarding house, which you left without paying
a poor widow (with five young children)
for your board, and she is very sick in consequence
of your cowardly villainy, and is
about to have another child, and her landlord
told her yesterday that she must move immediately,
or he would turn her into the street,
for not paying her rent. But I’ll stand none
of your wickedness. And now, Bennett, if
you don’t instantly pay me for washing and
mending your filthy and ragged clothes, I
will rope you on the spot. (She takes a rope
from behind her apron.)</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Call in the morning, and I will
certainly pay you.</p>

<p><i>Washer Woman</i>&mdash;I shall do no such thing,
you lying diddler. I will have it now, or I
will rope you, and pull your hair, and scratch
and bite, and maul you to a jelly. (She approaches
him with menacing gestures.)</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;There, good woman,&mdash;there’s
your money. (She seizes it and departs, wagging
her head and body with victorious vociferations.)</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;There, Master Kelly, you perceive
that I am very poor.</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Yes, sir, and so am I, and I like to be
with the poor, because they are far more kind
and generous than the rich.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i> (wiping a tear from his eye)&mdash;My
boy, I can see a noble heart in your breast,
and you remind me of the happy friends I left
in my native land, whom I may never see
again, and who are ignorant of the terrible
vicissitudes through which I have passed,
since I left my dear father’s roof.</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;What country is yours?</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Scotland.</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Ah! Scotland! My adored grandfather’s
native home! O, I love you much
better, now that I learn you came from Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;No more of this, dear boy. I cannot
talk of my present poverty, and of my
native skies, without sad emotions. And now
to business. Can you write a handsome
hand?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;I can write a plain hand.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Can you spell well?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Tolerably well, for a poor boy.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Do you understand figures?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Better than spelling or writing.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;How much do you want a week?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Enough to buy shoes and jacket and
trowsers, and pay my father and mother something
for my food and lodging.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Well, if you prove active, and
answer my purpose, I will reward you according
to my success in my new enterprise.</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;When do you want me to come?</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;You may stay now, and, after
sweeping out the office, and folding that pile
of papers in the corner, which I could not sell
yesterday, you can accompany me to my
Printers, Anderson &amp; Ward, in Ann street,
for the <i>Herald</i> papers of to-day. (John
sprinkles and sweeps out, and folds the papers
in half an hour, and he and Bennett start for
Ann street.)</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i> (at his printer’s in Ann street)&mdash;Mr.
Anderson, are my papers ready?</p>

<p><i>Anderson</i>&mdash;Yes, but you can’t have them
until you pay me for them.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;I have not got enough.</p>

<p><i>Anderson</i>&mdash;Then you can’t have them.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;But the newsboys are outside,
waiting for them.</p>

<p><i>Anderson</i>&mdash;I can’t help that.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;But, my dear sir, do let me have
them.</p>

<p><i>Anderson</i>&mdash;I shan’t do it.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Will you take my watch?</p>

<p><i>Anderson</i>&mdash;I have taken that twenty times,
and, as I am not a pawnbroker, I am sick of
taking your watch as security for the results
of my honest labor.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Do take it once more.</p>

<p><i>Anderson</i>&mdash;I told you, when you last redeemed
it, that I should not take it again.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i> (crying)&mdash;Do take it once more,
Mr. Anderson.</p>

<p><i>Anderson</i>&mdash;No, sir. Here, Rufus, put these
Heralds in a box, and nail it, and take the box
to my house.</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Do take his watch once more, kind
sir. Mr. Bennett has just employed me, and
I’m not afraid to trust him. Besides, just look
at his tears. See how big they are, and how
fast they flow and roll down his manly cheeks.
Do, sir, O do let him have the papers, and
spare his tears, and heal his broken heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Anderson</i> (looking over his spectacles)&mdash;Who
the devil are you?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;I am Johnny Kelly.</p>

<p><i>Anderson</i>&mdash;What! Does your father live
in the Fourteenth Ward?</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Yes, sir, and that’s just where I was
born, and have always lived, and always mean
to, and die there also, and, if possible, I intend
to be buried there, in some beautiful
cemetery, because I most fondly love the good
and generous people of the Fourteenth Ward.
And now, Mr. Anderson, have I not often
seen you at my father’s, on winter evenings,
telling each other funny and pleasing stories
of the past?</p>

<p><i>Anderson</i>&mdash;Seen me at your father’s, you
young rogue? Why, to be sure you have. I
came to America with your father and mother,
and my wife was present when you were born
in Mott street, and after your mother got well,
we had a great frolic at your Christening, and
went to the Park Theatre, and you were the
fattest and prettiest baby I ever saw.</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;You don’t say so? Give me your
hand&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Anderson</i> (jumping over the counter)&mdash;and
a kiss, too, you rosy little rascal. (Kisses
him, and then turns to Bennett.) There,
Bennett, take your papers, and give me your
old dumb silver turnip once more, but I’ll be
hanged before I will ever take it again. And
you may attribute your good luck this time
to this bright and pretty and honest little boy,
whom I have loved since his infancy. (Bennett
and John take the papers, and let the
boys outside have some, and then depart for
No. 20 Wall street.)</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i> (on his way to Wall street)&mdash;Well,
my lad, you have saved me to-day, and I’ll
remember it with gratitude as long as I live.
Tell your father and mother that I will come
and see them on Sunday evening, and take
tea with them. You can tell them that I will
let you have money enough on Saturday
night to get you a pair of shoes, as it won’t
do for you to be my clerk with naked feet.
Besides, I’m afraid you will get nails or splinters
in your bare feet, and have the lock jaw.
So, John, you had better ask your father to
let you wear his shoes until Saturday.</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Daddy hasn’t got any shoes. He has
been sick a long time with inflammatory rheumatism,
and he can’t work any more, and he
is obliged to go barefooted like myself.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Good Lord! Then ask your mother
to let you wear her shoes until Saturday.</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Mother aint got but one pair, and
they are slippers, and nearly worn out.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;Well, then, I must try to get you
some second-hand shoes in the morning. I
have only one pair myself, but I think I can
borrow some that are considerably worn from
one of my room-mates. So, good day, Johnny,
and come down early in the morning, and I
guess I’ll have some protection for your tender
feet.</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Good day, sir, and I hope you will
not cry any more until I see you.</p>

<p><i>Bennett</i>&mdash;I thank you, my dear boy, for
your genial sympathy, and I will strive not to
cry again until I see you. So, good by.</p>

<p><i>John</i>&mdash;Good by, sir. (They separate.)</p>

<h2>Incomparable Meanness.</h2>

<p>I taught Richard T. Compton grammar and
composition, while he was President of the
Board of Aldermen, at his residence, for which
he never fully paid me. I also went nearly
two years to Ambrose C. Kingsland’s princely
residence in Fifth Avenue, for the purpose of
his education in spelling, grammar, and composition,
and he has never paid me. Dick
Compton’s Bill is small compared with Kingsland’s,
who owes me a large sum. President
Compton and Ex-Mayor Kingsland were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
most corrupt men ever in the City Hall. I
have asserted, and still assert, and intend to
assert, to the very last hour of my existence,
that one of my Aldermanic pupils of the
scabby Common Councils of 1851 and 1852,
assured me that Ex-Mayor Kingsland made
more money while Mayor in 1851 and 1852,
than all the Mayors who preceded him, and
that he (my Aldermanic pupil) was an eye
witness to many of Kingsland’s plundering
operations. So, Compton and Kingsland, just
put all this in your pipes and smoke it, and
now, if you attempt to violate my person (for
publishing what I and you know to be true,
and what I yearn to prove in the Courts,)
you can come on as soon as you please, and
if I don’t tumble your thievish carcases into
the liquid fires of hell, I shall prove an unworthy
advocate of the millions you have
robbed and tried to starve, and of the land of
Greene and Perry from which I proudly hail.
I dunned Kingsland a long time for my just
dues, and wearied and shocked with his meanness,
I sent him a letter long since, presenting
him with my entire claim for learning him to
spell the simplest words. And if he will publish
my letter, I will give him a clock, gilded
with gold and silver, as an ornament to the
Chief parlor of his gorgeous mansion, which
he stole from the poor creatures who crawl in
nakedness to the corner groceries for food to
keep them from the grave. I recently asked
Compton for an advertisement for the <i>Alligator</i>,
in order to indirectly get the money he
owes me for instruction, but he even declined
the advertisement. And now I publicly give
him the entire balance of my claim against
him for instruction, while he was President of
the Board of Aldermen. Compton was as
corrupt when he was in the Common Council
in 1845 and 1846, as he was in 1852 and 1853.
His Ice Partner, Joseph Britton, was Assistant
Alderman of the Fifteenth Ward in 1848, and
Alderman in 1849, 1850, and 1851, and (as
Chairman of the Finance Committee, in connection
with James M. Bard,) he did not steal
over $200,000. It is most time for Compton
and Britton to return to the Common Council,
and make fresh grabs at the pockets and
throats of the people, who should seize such
villains and hang them in the Park, and thrust
their worthless bones into a felon’s grave.</p>

<h2>Spectres and Hobgoblins.</h2>

<p>Poor <i>Helen Jewett’s</i> ghost appeared to James
Gordon Bennett last night, and he leaped
from his bed, (<i>a la</i> Richard from his tent,)
and sweat terribly, and his jaws clattered,
and his frame trembled, and he screamed for
Grinnell and others to come to his relief. But
they could not respond, because they were
long since bled to death in the rear of the
City Hospital, and are at the High Court of
God, awaiting the speedy arrival of Bennett’s

<h2>To James Gordon Bennett and Frederic Hudson, his Cunning Secretary.</h2>

<p>How many members of your families and
<i>Herald</i> spies are quartered in the Departments
of our Municipal Government? in the
Post Office? in the Custom House? in the
Departments at Washington? I am anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to know, and, if you don’t soon publish the
interminable list, I will. Is Robert, your
former book-keeper, and other family relatives,
still in the Custom House, and other
public stations, and to keep them there, do
you jump Jim Crow from Fremont to Buchanan,
and defend the everlasting Wetmore
robbers, and the brothers Schell, and other
public plunderers? You know you do, you
double-dyed villains. And you know that
I know that Bennett and Fred and Ned Hudson,
and black-mail-bottle-holder-Galbraith,
and “Obscene-publication”-”British-alien”-”thirty-days-in-the-Tombs”-”Drury”-”go-between”-Fire
Marshal Baker, are an irredeemable
band of consummate scamps. I
mean to strip, and lash, and brand yourselves
and whole tribe of vultures, so that you cannot
longer deceive the people. So, prepare,
ye two-faced, nauseous, scabby, leprous, and
hellish gang of thieves, for a dissection that
will enlarge the eyes of honest men, and
make them stare like affrighted owls. You
have quoted Scripture long enough, and I intend
that you shall hereafter quote from your
friend the Devil, and cease your hypocrisy.</p>

<p class="p1">So that not one cent of the enormous receipts
of this famous Ball has been devoted to the
purchase of one little loaf of John Hecker’s
Bread, nor to the relief of the indigent thousands,
whom the receipts of this Ball were intended
to relieve. The <i>Hunter Woodis Society</i>
Managers told me on Monday last, that
the receipts of the Crystal Palace Ball were
§10,147,38, and that the expenses were
$6,828,03, leaving a balance in the hands of
their Treasurer of $3,319,35, which is now in
their Safe, and that they have not disbursed
one cent for bread nor any thing else for the
relief of the poor, and do not intend to, until
the next winter. I had a long interview with
the officers of the self-constituted <i>Hunter
Woodis Society</i>, (at their official quarters,)
who are remarkably well clad, and smelt very
strongly of cologne and pomatum, and they
seemed extremely happy in their gaudy easy
chairs, and I learn that they can often be seen
on the fashionable avenues with fast steeds, and
at the Italian Opera, and the aristocratic clubs.
One of the leaders of the <i>Hunter Woodis Society</i>
(doubtless fearing that I was about to
let loose my <i>Alligator</i> upon himself and associates,)
breathed honied words during my visit
to the Society, and boldly said that Peter
Cooper was anything but an honest man, but
that the <i>Hunter Woodis</i> Managers were all
honorable men, and that all the members of
the <i>Hunter Woodis Society</i> were Know Nothings.
He told me this three times, lest I
should forget it, the fool supposing that I regarded
Know Nothing thieves with less
abhorrence than Irish or British thieves, of the
Busteed, Connolly, or Matsell brand. I believe
that most of the charitable funds of the
“American and Foreign Emigrant Protective
and Employment Society,” and of the “Academy
of Music and Crystal Palace Balls,” have
gone into the pockets and bellies and bladders
of the scoundrels who collected those sacred
funds for the immediate relief of the Emigrants
and Starving Poor of New York.</p>

<h2>Startling Revelations.</h2>

<p>In my coming revelations of Bennett and
Hudson’s rascalities, I shall prove that the
former strove to black mail me during my
protracted Mnemonic Controversy with Professor
Francis Fauvel Gourard in 1843, for
which I drew a revolver on <i>Satan</i> in the <i>Herald</i>
office. I shall also prove that I got Bennett
the Corporation Printing at $3,000 per annum,
through my influence with my Aldermanic
pupils,&mdash;that I wrote the Printing Report,
proposing to give Bennett $3,000 a
year for the Common Council Printing, and
the other Journals only $1,000 a year,&mdash;that I
told Bennett I was teaching the Aldermen,
and, among them, Alderman A. A. Denman,
of the Sixteenth Ward, who was Chairman of
the Committee to whom the Corporation
Printing was referred,&mdash;that I bet Bennett
$100 that I would get the Corporation Printing
for the <i>Herald</i> at $3,000 per annum,&mdash;that
I not only wrote the Printing Report for the
Committee, but got it adopted by both Boards
of the Common Council, and got the Mayor
to sign it, when Bennett gave me the $100,
which was a part of the $250 that I have
only received from Bennett during my voluntary
connection with the <i>Herald</i> since 1836,&mdash;that
after I got the Corporation Printing for
Bennett, I continued to scourge the Common
Council through the Fire Reports of Alfred
Carson, and a Caucus was held, and a vote
passed, demanding me to cease my philippics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
against the Common Council, because they
had given Bennett the Corporation Printing
at my request,&mdash;that I told the Alderman who
was delegated by the Aldermanic Caucus to
request me to cease my philippics, that I should
not comply with their monstrous demand,
and that I would see Bennett and Hudson and
the <i>Herald</i> effaced from the earth, before I
would desert Alfred Carson and his noble
band of firemen,&mdash;that this Alderman then
went to Bennett, (by direction of the Caucus,)
and requested him not to publish my Fire
philippics against the Common Council, and
Bennett, (fearing they would deprive him of
the Printing if he refused,) cowardly and
mercenarily complied, and also pledged
himself to conceal the anticipated robberies
of 1852 and 1853,&mdash;that the
Common Council was so pleased with
Bennett’s course, that they made him overtures,
through which he acquired a princely
fortune, as he did under Fernando Wood’s administration,&mdash;that
one of the members of the
Committee, who reported in favor of Bennett’s
Printing, (who was my pupil,) received by a
vote of the Common Council, 204 valuable lots
on the banks of the East River, which he
holds to this day,&mdash;that this corrupt Alderman
boldly besought me, at his house at midnight,
to abandon Alfred Carson, and go into
the embraces of the Common Council, which
would ensure me a splendid fortune,&mdash;that I
nearly smote him on the spot with my maledictions
and my indignant glances,&mdash;that this
Alderman was a bosom friend and confidant
of the then Aldermen Tiemann and Peter
Cooper,&mdash;that he is the sacred friend of Mayor
Tiemann and Peter Cooper now,&mdash;that Mayor
Tiemann and Peter Cooper fear this Alderman,
who has known them and all their political villainy
since 1828,&mdash;that this is the Alderman
who first told me of Mayor Tiemann’s and
Peter Cooper’s public robberies,&mdash;that Mayor
Tiemann was an Alderman of the Common
Council that gave Bennett the Corporation
Printing, and voted for it,&mdash;that this Alderman
introduced me to Alderman Tiemann on
the very day that Tiemann originated the
Ward Island Purchases, which have been and
are the foulest sources of corruption and plunder
in the annals of municipal legislation,&mdash;that
Tiemann and this Alderman acted in concert
in the Ward Island Purchases, and he assured
me at the time that Tiemann was the
slyest and most pliable member of the Board
of Aldermen, when there was an enormous
sum to be made at one grab, but that Tiemann
would not peril his reputation by embarking
in small plundering operations&mdash;that Gov.
Wm. T. Pinkney recently told me in the rear
of his Insurance Office in Wall street, that this
was precisely Tiemann’s course while a member
of the Board of Ten Governors, who
never could be drawn into small operations.
I will also prove that Bennett
has always been a Secret Corporation
Plunderer, and also a State and National
Thief,&mdash;that his unceasing denunciation of
the Common Council, and the Legislature,
and Congress, is only to blind the people,
and enable him to steal the more,&mdash;that
Frederick Hudson, his Secretary, while Bennett
was in Europe, got $30,000 from the
Common Council, for suppressing one of
Alfred Carson’s terrible philippics against
the Corporation, at the election of all the Assistant
Engineers of the Fire Department,&mdash;that
one of my Aldermanic pupils assured
me that §30,000 was the sum that Hudson
received, and which I publicly nailed
on the brow of Hudson at the time,
in the <i>New York Sun</i>, and other Journals,
including the <i>Firemen’s Journal</i>. These
are only some of the numerous villanies I
shall prove against these scoundrels. I will
also show that Bennett and Fred and Ned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Hudson conceived the Parker Vein and Potosi
Swindles, through which thousands were
ruined, including widows and orphans, and
my brother William and his wife and interesting
children, who were reduced from affluence
and happiness, to utter destitution. Poor
brother William is now a skeleton and shadow
and wanderer in the streets of Saint Louis, and
forever separated from his wife and adored
offspring, through the heartless mercenary
machinations and deviltry of Bennett and the
Hudsons of the <i>Herald</i>. When the details of
these Revelations are spread before the world,
the question will be forever settled as to the
overshadowing Black Mail Operations of the
<i>New York Herald</i>.</p>

<h2>Life of Stephen H. Branch.</h2>

<p>From Louisville I went to Wheeling, and
thence to Baltimore, where I visited a noble
youth who had been my classmate, and during
my illness at Columbian College, he was
ever by my side, when young White was absent.
He was now an invalid, and about to
leave for the Mediterranean in a clipper vessel,
owned by his father, and strongly urged
me to accompany him without charge. In
about a week we left Baltimore for Gibraltar,
with the captain, first and second mate, and a
choice crew. We had but one gale in the Atlantic,
and, after a brief sojourn at Gibraltar,
we passed on, touching at various ports, until
we reached Alexandria. We visited the
Pyramids, and passed a moonlight evening on
the Nile, and went to Damascus, Jerusalem,
Constantinople, Athens, and Rome, where
we sailed on the Tiber, and reveled on
the soil of the departed Romans. We left for
Baltimore, and had terrific gales in the Mediterranean,
and in the Atlantic. About ten
days before our arrival in Baltimore, my
friend died, which shook me to the soul with
grief. On our arrival at Baltimore, his father
and mother and sisters kissed the dust in
agony, and treated me like a son or brother.
The father gave me $100, and I departed for
New York, in deep affliction at my irreparable
loss of a generous youth who had been so
kind to me. I became ill, and nearly died,
and exhausted the $100, and wrote to father,
who sent me money, and I recovered after a
severe struggle with the arrows of death. I
again saw Lewis Tappan, and began to teach
colored persons, for which I received a miserable
pittance. I now obtained board in
Beekman street, with Mrs. Tripler, some of
whose boarders were named Thompson,
Woodbury, Chapman, and Cuniffe. A Mr.
Bliss boarded there, who had been an eminent
bookseller, and an early friend to William
Cullen Bryant, and, as he was now very poor,
Mr. Bryant obtained a situation for him in the
Custom House. Mr. Bryant often came to
Mrs. Tripler’s to see Mr. Bliss, and they
weekly dined at the Spanish Hotel, in Fulton
street. It was a pleasing and noble spectacle
to behold Mr. Bryant’s fidelity to Mr. Bliss in
his penury and old age. Henry J. Raymond
(now editor of the <i>New York Times</i>) was in
the employ of Horace Greeley, at $4 a week,
with a promise of more, if he <i>proved true</i> to
Greeley, and became an expert paragraphist.
Raymond roomed and slept with my brother
Thomas, at a boarding house in Beekman
street, near mine, and they each paid $1 75 a
week, for board and lodging, exclusive of
washing, ironing, and mending. Their room
was next to the roof, and their only window
was the sky light. There was a large pillar
in the centre of their funny little extra attic
cubby-hole, which had recently been placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
there, to prevent the dilapidated and shrunken
and sunken roof from utterly caving in, and
burying the entire inhabitants of the superannuated
edifice, including the Lieutenant Governor
in embryo of the Empire State. A man
ninety-four years old lived over the way, who
told me that he was born in the venerable
building in question, and that his aged aunt
often told him that she was born there, and
that the building could not be less than one
hundred and seventy years old. I closely
examined the beams and chimneys, and formed
the opinion that it had seen not less than
two hundred winters, including summer tornadoes.
I often visited brother Thomas, and
always dreaded climbing the ladder that led
to his and Raymond’s apartment. And when
I entered their comic room, I had to take off
my hat, and squat down, and often when I
arose to depart, I bumped my head severely
against the pigeon-house ceiling. But Tommy
and the proud Governor and Editor in the invisible
future were very short, and could walk
erect as turkeys without bumping their heads,
and they really seemed to enjoy their little
oven amazingly. They had but one squeaking
cot, (that Parson Brown, their host,
bought at auction,) and only one stool, and a
pine table with only three legs. The fourth
leg was Raymond’s cane, which he placed
under the table when he wrote his $4 a week
articles for Greeley’s <i>Tribune</i>. And it was a
funny spectacle for me to see Raymond seated
on the stool, beside the three legged pine
table, (with his hair shaved to the skull.)
writing for his life, with Tom on the squealing
cot, waiting for Raymond to close his last
paragraph, so that he (Tom) could have a
chance to write a letter in answer to an Advertiser
in the <i>New York Sun</i> for a clerk.
They had no wash bowl, nor pitcher, nor
comb, nor looking glass, and washed their
hands and face in the yard with cistern water.
I bought a pocket comb for Tommy, which
he often loaned to Raymond, and finally sold
it to him for a free ticket to a concert, which
Greeley gave Raymond. I at last obtained a
situation for Tommy, and about daylight
rushed into his boarding house, (the door was
always open all night,) and up I flew the last
flight of stairs and precarious ladder, and
popped into their cosy room, and there they
lay, reposing and dreaming of the past, and
of better days in perspective. Tommy was
on his side, and his face was partially eclipsed
with his sheet, but Raymond was flat on his
back, and he had a tooth-ache poultice on his
cheek, covered with his handkerchief, which
encircled his head around his ears, and he
looked pale, and plaintive, and care worn,
and I pitied him. I softly thrust my hand
into the clothes, in pursuit of Tom’s feet,
which I began to tickle, when Tom (who was
always as nervous and ticklish as a very susceptible
girl) suddenly popped over on the
other side, and gave Raymond’s poultice n
bang, when the latter gave a growl, and
popped over on his other side, and, in doing
so, dislocated his poultice, which came out in
great profusion, and run all over his face and
down into his neck, and the bed clothes, and
yet the Governor and Editor in embryo snored
on, as though nothing had transpired. I
then made another lunge for Tommy’s feet,
and grabbed one, and held it, and tickled it
tremendously, which proved to be Raymond’s,
who darted up from his pillow, and exclaimed:
“Sir: What under Heaven are you doing
with my feet? I demand you to let them
alone. I despise your impertinence,” and,
without waiting for my explanation or apology,
he violently buried himself in the clothes,
and off he went into a profound and noisy
slumber. I seized Tom by his ear and hair
and arm, and dragged him from the bed, and
he unconsciously pulled all the bed clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
with him, as he was yet about half asleep. It
always took about half an hour to thoroughly
arouse Tom from his morning orisons. But
when I told Tom I had got him a situation, he
awoke mighty quick. Raymond was so mad
to find himself stripped of all the bed clothes,
that he threatened to tell Parson Brown, the
host, but Tom told him if he did, that he
would give him the worst thrashing he ever
had, which made Raymond tremble. Although
Tom was much shorter and weighed infinitely
less than Raymond, yet he could strike a
powerful blow, and Raymond knew it. Tom
and Raymond slept together two nights after
that, without saying a word to each other,
but Sunday morning came, and as Raymond
was a stiff Presbyterian, and attended Dr.
Potts’ Church, he extended the hand of forgiveness
and friendship to little Tommy, who
accepted his apology, and they were sweeter
friends than ever. I now get mournful
intelligence from New Orleans and Providence.
I receive news of the death of my
dear brother Albert at New Orleans, and my
father writes me that my wife’s father told
him that he was about to induce his daughter
to apply for a divorce from me. My father
told him that I had been in delicate health
for several years, which had kept me very
poor,&mdash;that he was obliged, from humanity,
to send me money occasionally, and that under
these melancholy circumstances, and in view
of all that had transpired in previous years,
if he chose to induce his daughter to apply
for a divorce, he could not help it, and that
probably neither himself nor myself would
oppose it. My father-in-law then said that
there was no alternative, and his daughter
would apply for a divorce immediately, and
my father and father-in-law bade each other
a cold farewell, and never recognised each
other afterwards. The divorce soon followed,
to which I made not the shadow of resistance.
What rendered the divorce extremely painful
was the almost daily visits of my wife to my
father’s house ever since my disastrous crisis
in 1837, when I was confined in the Providence
jail. And even after the divorce, my
faithful and unfortunate wife continued her
visits to my father’s for a long period, without
the knowledge of her father and mother, and
wept, and wailed, (as my step mother has
often told me,) like the disconsolate and ever-weeping
Niobe. My father-in-law owned
several ships, and not long after the divorce,
the carrying trade was suddenly paralysed,
and he failed for an immense sum, and he
struggled, and tottered, and fell, and never
recovered his commercial position. And the
magnificent mansion in which I was married,
was violently seized during his occupation,
and his furniture thrown into the street, and
himself and family ruthlessly ejected from
its palacious halls. I lamented his downfall,
but his fellow merchants did not, as they ever
regarded him as a merciless miser. I brooded
long on my wife’s calamities and my own, and
with a melancholy heart I went to Saint
Thomas’s Church on a cloudy summer day, and
the Sexton politely escorted me to a pew.
I had not long been seated, when a youth
entered with beautiful eyes and hair and
features of touching sadness, and took a seat
beside me. He so strongly resembled a youth
named Charles Manton, who early died, (and
whom I loved as no other being not of my
kindred blood,) that I could not withdraw
my eyes from his fascinating form and expression.
During the prayers and chaunts, we divided
the sacred book between us, and at the
close of the exercises, we left the pew together.
As we were about to leave the church,
I inquired his name, and residence, which he
readily imparted, informing me that his name
was Charles A. Jesup,&mdash;that he had recently
lost his father,&mdash;that his mother resided in</p>
